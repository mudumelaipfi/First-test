                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <P>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest land animal on Earth, instantly recognizable by its long neck, towering legs, and unique spotted coat. Adult male giraffes can reach heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet), while females are slightly shorter at around 4.5 meters. Much of this height comes from their elongated necks, which can be over 2 meters long and contain the same number of vertebrae (seven) as humans — only theirs are significantly lengthened. Their height gives them a distinct advantage, allowing them to browse the tops of trees that other herbivores cannot reach, primarily feeding on acacia leaves, seed pods, fruits, and flowers. Giraffes have prehensile tongues that can reach up to 45 cm in length, which helps them grasp and strip foliage from thorny branches with ease. Their long legs also contribute to their speed and mobility, enabling them to run at speeds up to 60 km/h in short bursts to escape predators. Giraffes possess large eyes positioned on the sides of their heads, giving them wide peripheral vision — essential for detecting threats from a distance. Their coats feature irregular patches or spots that vary in shape and color between subspecies and serve as effective camouflage among trees and bushes. Despite their gentle appearance, giraffes can deliver powerful kicks capable of killing lions or other predators when threatened.

                <P>Giraffes are social animals that live in loose herds, often referred to as "towers." These groups typically consist of females and their offspring, though males may form bachelor groups or roam alone. Unlike animals with rigid hierarchies, giraffe herds are fluid, with individuals coming and going freely. Social bonds are formed through grooming and necking behaviors, especially among young males who engage in “sparring” — using their necks as weapons in dominance battles. Giraffes are non-territorial and generally peaceful, with no set leader within a herd. Their daily activity is centered around browsing, and they can spend up to 75% of their day feeding. Due to their unique neck and leg anatomy, drinking water can be awkward and risky; giraffes must splay their legs or kneel, making them vulnerable to predators like lions or crocodiles during this process. To compensate, they often hydrate through moisture in their food and may only drink every few days. Giraffes sleep very little — usually only 10 to 30 minutes at a time, standing or occasionally lying down. Calves are born after a gestation period of around 15 months and can stand and walk within an hour of birth. However, the mortality rate among young giraffes is high due to predation by lions, leopards, and hyenas. Giraffes play a vital role in their ecosystems by helping shape plant growth through selective feeding and by dispersing seeds over large distances.

                <P>Although giraffes are widespread across many parts of Africa, their population is in decline, with some subspecies facing serious threats. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), giraffes are classified as “Vulnerable,” with certain subspecies like the Kordofan and Nubian giraffe listed as “Critically Endangered.” Major threats include habitat loss due to agricultural expansion, deforestation, and infrastructure development. In some regions, giraffes are also hunted illegally for meat, hide, or trophies, and they are increasingly affected by climate change, which alters the availability of their food sources. Despite these challenges, conservationists and wildlife organizations are working to protect giraffes through anti-poaching patrols, habitat restoration, and community-based conservation programs. Giraffe populations have shown signs of recovery in well-protected areas such as national parks and private game reserves. Beyond their ecological role, giraffes have become cultural and educational ambassadors for African wildlife. They are featured in countless children’s books, documentaries, and zoo programs, helping raise global awareness about African biodiversity. Ecotourism also plays a critical role in giraffe conservation, as visitors from around the world travel to see these gentle giants in the wild, contributing funds that support wildlife management. As efforts continue to ensure the survival of the species, giraffes remain a powerful reminder of Africa’s natural beauty and the importance of preserving it for future generations.

                <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <P>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth and are known for their intelligence, memory, and strong family bonds. They are part of the family Elephantidae, and there are three recognized species: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. These majestic creatures are herbivores and spend up to 16 hours a day eating plants, leaves, bark, and fruits. An elephant's trunk — a fusion of its nose and upper lip — is a powerful tool used for breathing, smelling, grabbing, and making sounds. Adult elephants can weigh between 2,700 and 6,000 kilograms and live for around 60–70 years in the wild.
                </P>
                
                <P>Elephants are highly social animals that live in matriarchal groups, often led by the oldest and wisest female. These herds consist of mothers, daughters, and young males, while older males may live alone or in small bachelor groups. Elephants display complex emotions such as joy, grief, empathy, and cooperation. They have been observed mourning the death of herd members, returning to the bones of their dead, and even attempting to bury them. Their large brains, especially the temporal lobes, are highly developed, making them among the smartest animals on the planet, capable of using tools, solving problems, and even painting.
                </P> 

                <P>Despite their strength and intelligence, elephants face many threats due to human activity. Habitat loss, climate change, and especially poaching for ivory have led to a significant decline in elephant populations, particularly in Africa. Conservation efforts led by governments and organizations aim to protect elephant habitats, stop illegal ivory trade, and educate communities about the importance of elephants to ecosystems. Some regions have seen population recovery thanks to protected areas and anti-poaching laws. However, ongoing efforts are crucial to ensure that these incredible animals do not vanish from the wild.
